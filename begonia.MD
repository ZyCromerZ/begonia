* Upstream to 4.14.210 from https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common branch android-4.14-q
* compiled using using clang, gcc, dtc for all build
* for kernel changes, just check my kernel commits history, im lazy to type it because only a few changes :p

Note:
* about info rebased kernel, just <a href="https://github.com/ZyCromerZ/begonia/blob/changelogs/README.MD">check here</a> for some info
* and now DF is just a renamed kernels
* DeathFlower Keqing and mona same as Tercydux-Tiris
* implement SLMK to DeathFlower Mona (not like Keqing using ALMK)
* so now DF mona is test kernel xD
* what is the difference between gcc and clang dtc? <a href=https://t.me/QknTercyduxGroup/198914>check here</a> maybe it will help u
